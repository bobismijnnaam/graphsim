# GraphSim

GraphSim is a toolkit made by Bob Rubbens to simulate epidemics in graphs. It supplies functionality to generate various graphs, including Erdos-RÃ«ny random graphs and Preferential Attachment random graphs. It can simulate infections of various shapes and sizes using arbitrary graphs and either the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model or the IC (Information Cascade) model. It's main purpose was facilitating a framework for doing simulations for my seventh Honours module, "Complex Networks".

It also contains (currently undocumented) functionality to generate animated movies of epidemic simulations of small graph, as demo'd here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqZQqfRWYNo

# Dependencies

# Special thanks
 I want to thank Paula Felix, for teaming up with me this project, and Nelly Litvak, for her interesting lectures the second half of the module.
